# Master_Thesis : Modelling Climate change effect on the economy through health

This is the repository of my Master Thesis, done at Sciences Po under the supervision of [Jeanne Commault](https://www.jcommault.com). 
The second member of my jury is [Paul Bouscasse](https://www.paul-bouscasse.com).

You can go to its [website](https://www.paulogcd.com/Master_Thesis), in which I try to explain my work in the most intuitive way.

More will come soon!
