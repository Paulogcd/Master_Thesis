The two main plots I manage to obtain are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility trajectories with extreme weather deviation probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregated intertemporal utilities in function of weather deviation probability\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first figure represents the aggregated utility of two societies, one in which there is no weather deviation at all (blue line), and the other where the weather is always in a deviation state (red line). Note that the general decreasing trend with period is due to the absence of individual reproduction in this model.\nThe second figure represents the different levels of aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of the probability of the weather being normal. We see what seems to be a linear relationship between the aggregated intertemporal utility and the probability of the weather being normal."
