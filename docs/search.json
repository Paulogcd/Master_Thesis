We can then obtain the following expression for consumption:\n\\[c_{t} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1}\\]\nPlugging it into the maximization program, we obtain:\n\\[ \\max_{\\{l_{t},s_{t+1}\\}_{t=1}^{100}}\n{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=1}^{100} \\beta^{t}\\cdot \\frac{\\left(l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1}\\right)^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}-\\xi_{t}\\cdot \\frac{l_{t}^{1+\\varphi}}{1+\\varphi}\\right]}\\]\nThe F.O.C. with respect to labor implies:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    l_{t}^{\\varphi}\\cdot \\xi_{t} = \\left[l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t})- s_{t+1}\\right]^{-\\rho}\\cdot z_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe can develop the decomposition of consumption if and only if \\(\\rho \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Indeed, this equation is of form \\(x = (x-\\alpha)^{\\beta} \\cdot z\\). With \\(\\beta\\notin \\mathbb{N}\\), is a transcendental equation.\nWe can now try to compute the F.O.C. first, and then make use of the Budget Constraint. The Lagrangian function associated witht the maximization program of the agent is: \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n        \\mathcal{L}(c_{t},l_{t},s_{t+1};\\lambda_t,\\gamma_{t}) &\n        = \\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\sum_{t=1}^{100} \\beta^{t}\\cdot ((\\frac{c_{t}^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}-\\xi_{t}\\cdot\\frac{l_{t}^{1+\\varphi}}{1+\\varphi}) \\\\\n        & +\\lambda_{t}\\cdot \\left(l_{t}\\cdot z_{t}+s_{t}\\cdot (1+r_{t})-c_{t}-s_{t+1}\\right) \\\\\n        & + \\gamma_{t}\\cdot \\left(s_{t+1}-\\underline{s}\\right))\\Big] \\\\\n    \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe First Order Conditions are the following:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t}} = 0 \\iff c_{t}^{-\\rho} = \\lambda_{t}\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial l_{t}} = 0 \\iff \\lambda_{t}\\cdot z_{t} = \\xi_{t}\\cdot l_{t}^{\\varphi}\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial s_{t+1}} = 0 \\iff \\lambda_{t} = \\beta \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\lambda_{t+1}\\cdot (1+r_{t+1})\\right] + \\gamma_{t}\\]\nWe first note that we must obtain a closed-form solution for \\(c_{t}\\) and \\(l_{t}\\) to obtain the optimal value of \\(s_{t+1}\\). Indeed, since \\(s_{t+1}\\) is linear in \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), we would need to plug the closed-form solutions of \\(c_{t}\\) and \\(l_{t}\\) in the budget constraint.\nReplacing the expression of \\(\\lambda_{t}\\) in the two other equation yields:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    c^{-\\rho}_{t}\\cdot z_{t} = \\xi_{t}\\cdot l_{t}^{\\varphi} \\iff\n        \\begin{cases}\n        & c_t = \\left[\\frac{\\xi_{t}\\cdot l_{t}^{\\varphi}}{z_{t}}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}}\\\\\n        & l_{t} = \\left[\\frac{c_{t}^{-\\rho}z_{t}\\cdot}{\\xi_{t}}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\] And \\[\\begin{equation}\n    c^{-\\rho}_{t} = \\beta \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[c^{-\\rho}_{t+1}\\cdot (1+r_{t+1})\\right] + \\gamma_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAssuming that the budget constraint binds, it becomes, as previously seen:\n\\[c_{t} + s_{t+1} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t})\n\\iff\nc_{t} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1}\n\\]\nThis leads to the following equation system:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n    & c_t = \\left[\\frac{\\xi_{t}\\cdot l_{t}^{\\varphi}}{z_{t}}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}} \\\\\n    & c_{t} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\\iff\\] \\[ \\left[\\frac{\\xi_{t}\\cdot l_{t}^{\\varphi}}{z_{t}}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1} \\] \\[\\iff\\] \\[ l_{t}^{-\\frac{\\varphi}{\\rho}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\xi_{t}}{z_{t}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}} = l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1} \\] \\[\\iff\\] \\[ l_{t}^{-\\frac{\\varphi}{\\rho}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{z_{t}}{\\xi_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}} - l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} - s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t}) - s_{t+1} = 0 \\]\nThis is a transcendental equation of form \\(x^{\\alpha}\\cdot b - x\\cdot y - c = 0\\), which admits a solution if and only if \\(-\\frac{\\varphi}{\\rho} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). This condition seems unrealistic in our context:\nNote that if we set \\(-\\rho\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) and further develop the last equation in the budget constraint binding attempt, we end up with the same condition.\nIf we try to solve it backwards, we now go to the last period. At the last period, \\(s_{t+1} = \\underline{s}\\) for sure: Since there is no future, the agent will borrow as much as they can, or will at least not save anything more than what is imposed by the constraint.\nFor simplification, let \\(\\underline{s}\\) be fixed such that: \\(\\underline{s} = 0\\). The new optimality condition is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    l_{t}^{\\varphi}\\cdot \\xi_{t} = \\left[l_{t}\\cdot z_{t} + s_{t}\\cdot(1+r_{t})\\right]^{-\\rho}\\cdot z_{t}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAlthough we simplified the term at the exponential of which we have \\(-\\rho\\), this is still a transcendental equation due to the sum of labor income and income coming from savings of last period, and the problem remain the same.\nGo back"

Note that the general decreasing trend with period is due to the absence of individual reproduction in this model.\nThe second figure represents the different levels of aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of the probability of the weather being normal. We see what seems to be a linear relationship between the aggregated intertemporal utility and the probability of the weather being normal."

If an agent goes from good health to bad health, they suffer a productivity shock, making them go from the higher surface to the lower one.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSurvival function\nThe plot is about the final survival probability, which is function of several intermediary probability funtions. In this plot, we can see that there are two surfaces, that differ starting a certain age. Here again, the two surfaces correspond to two different health status.

Indeed, not only does it affect the general quality of peopleâs life, imply new public policy trade-off in the health sector, but it also has several impacts at the individual level. From an economic perspective, expected changes in temperature distribution could lead not only to aggregated utility shocks through a change in global life conditions, but could also lead to different individual choices in terms of labor supply and savings. Given the existing findings, it is also very important to take into consideration the potential interaction effects of these temperature deviation with variable creating heterogeneity in the population, such as base health types, initial income and/or wealth, etc."

The authors use PSID data to identify different âhealth typesâ, that can predict most of the health history through the life of an individual. They point out that a Markov process of order 1 is not enough to capture the change of health status, although using higher orders is resources demanding. THey include a structural model in which they study economic choices of agents, and include several features such as medical insurance and retirement. The article is available here.\nCarleton et al., 2022: Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits, The Quarterly Journal of Economics. The authors include the income as a parameter in the mortality-temperature function, which seems necessary, and develop a conceptual framework to take into account adaptation. The article is available here.\nGould et al., 2024, Temperature extremes impact mortality and morbidity differently, NBER Working Papers. The authors use a Californian dataset including visits at emergency departments to study the response of health to temperature. They also try to differentiate between morbidity, understood as the general state of health, and mortality, associated to the death rate. They point out that the morbidity, for which they use non fatal events leading to an emergency department visit, react differently than mortality. The article is available here."
