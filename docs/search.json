The two main plots I manage to obtain are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility trajectories with extreme weather deviation probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregated intertemporal utilities in function of weather deviation probability\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first figure represents the aggregated utility of two societies, one in which there is no weather deviation at all (blue line), and the other where the weather is always in a deviation state (red line). Note that the general decreasing trend with period is due to the absence of individual reproduction in this model.\nThe second figure represents the different levels of aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of the probability of the weather being normal. We see what seems to be a linear relationship between the aggregated intertemporal utility and the probability of the weather being normal."

    "text": "Hello, I am Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias, a student in the Master of Research in Economics at Sciences Po, and this webpage is dedicated to my Master Thesis.\nI would like to study the economic effect of temperature variations induced by climate change on health.\nSchematically, I would like to inquire about the red links in the following diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Climate change] --&gt; B[Temperature distribution]\n  B --&gt; C[Other variables]\n  B --&gt; D[Health of individuals] \n  D --&gt; E[Economic production]\n  C --&gt; E\n\nlinkStyle default stroke:black\nlinkStyle 2 stroke:red\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:red\nstyle D color:red\n\nclassDef linkLabel fill:none,stroke:none;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rich literature has identified several channels through which temperature can affect economy, among which we can mention:\n\nMortality\n\nPotential heatwaves could increase the mortality rates, especially for very young or elderly populations.\n\nMorbidity\n\nTemperature shifts could affect the quality of live through a degraded health status.\n\nLabor productivity\n\nHigher or more varying temperatures could reduce the labor productivity for blue and white collars.\n\nAreas liveability\n\nSome regions will become too hot to live in and will cause migration.\n\nCapital productivity\n\nCertain equipements and machines require some temperature to be useable.\n\n\nIn this context, the potential effect of temperature shifts on health is of particular importance. Indeed, not only does it affect the general quality of peopleâ€™s life, imply new public policy trade-off in the health sector, but it also has several impacts at the individual level. From an economic perspective, expected changes in temperature distribution could lead not only to aggregated utility shocks through a change in global life conditions, but could also lead to different individual choices in terms of labor supply and savings. Given the existing findings, it is also very important to take into consideration the potential interaction effects of these temperature deviation with variable creating heterogeneity in the population, such as base health types, initial income and/or wealth, etc.\nFor now, you can find my working models in the Models page.\nMore will come soon!"
