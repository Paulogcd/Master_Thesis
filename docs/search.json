    "text": "Here are some of the important bibliographical references I use in the development of my conceptual framework:\n\nDe Nardi et al., 2024: The Lifetime Costs of Bad Health, The Review of Economic Studies. The authors use PSID data to identify different “health types”, that can predict most of the health history through the life of an individual. They point out that a Markov process of order 1 is not enough to capture the change of health status, although using higher orders is resources demanding. THey include a structural model in which they study economic choices of agents, and include several features such as medical insurance and retirement. The article is available here.\nCarleton et al., 2022: Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits, The Quarterly Journal of Economics. The authors include the income as a parameter in the mortality-temperature function, which seems necessary, and develop a conceptual framework to take into account adaptation. The article is available here.\nGould et al., 2024, Temperature extremes impact mortality and morbidity differently, NBER Working Papers. The authors use a Californian dataset including visits at emergency departments to study the response of health to temperature. They also try to differentiate between morbidity, understood as the general state of health, and mortality, associated to the death rate. They point out that the morbidity, for which they use non fatal events leading to an emergency department visit, react differently than mortality. The article is available here."

    "text": "Overview\nI would like to study the economic effect of temperature variations induced by climate change on health.\nSchematically, I would like to inquire about the red links in the following diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Climate change] --&gt; B[Temperature distribution]\n  B --&gt; C[Other variables]\n  B --&gt; D[Health of individuals] \n  D --&gt; E[Economic production]\n  C --&gt; E\n\nlinkStyle default stroke:black\nlinkStyle 2 stroke:red\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:red\nstyle D color:red\n\nclassDef linkLabel fill:none,stroke:none;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rich literature has identified several channels through which temperature can affect economy, among which we can mention:\n\nMortality\n\nPotential heatwaves could increase the mortality rates, especially for very young or elderly populations.\n\nMorbidity\n\nTemperature shifts could affect the quality of live through a degraded health status.\n\nLabor productivity\n\nHigher or more varying temperatures could reduce the labor productivity for blue and white collars.\n\nAreas liveability\n\nSome regions will become too hot to live in and will cause migration.\n\nCapital productivity\n\nCertain equipements and machines require some temperature to be useable.\n\n\nIn this context, the potential effect of temperature shifts on health is of particular importance. Indeed, not only does it affect the general quality of people’s life, imply new public policy trade-off in the health sector, but it also has several impacts at the individual level. From an economic perspective, expected changes in temperature distribution could lead not only to aggregated utility shocks through a change in global life conditions, but could also lead to different individual choices in terms of labor supply and savings. Given the existing findings, it is also very important to take into consideration the potential interaction effects of these temperature deviation with variable creating heterogeneity in the population, such as base health types, initial income and/or wealth, etc."

The two main plots I manage to obtain are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility trajectories with extreme weather deviation probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregated intertemporal utilities in function of weather deviation probability\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first figure represents the aggregated utility of two societies, one in which there is no weather deviation at all (blue line), and the other where the weather is always in a deviation state (red line). Note that the general decreasing trend with period is due to the absence of individual reproduction in this model.\nThe second figure represents the different levels of aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of the probability of the weather being normal. We see what seems to be a linear relationship between the aggregated intertemporal utility and the probability of the weather being normal."

It aims to add to the general framework a continuous variable for temperature.\nIn this context:\n\nhealth is binary (good or bad health status),\nweather is represented by a continuous temperature variable,\nthe temperature affects the probability of being in a given health status, and survive, at the next period,\nthe probabilities of health status and survival are of higher dimension,\nI tried implementing the first version of numerical method resolution.\n\nTo illustrate this model, two plots can be displayed here, corresponding to two functions of the model: - Productivity function - Survival function\n\nProductivity function\nThe first one is about the productivity in function of the age and of temperature deviation. In this plot, we can see that there are two different surfaces. They correspond to the two different health status. If an agent goes from good health to bad health, they suffer a productivity shock, making them go from the higher surface to the lower one.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSurvival function\nThe plot is about the final survival probability, which is function of several intermediary probability funtions. In this plot, we can see that there are two surfaces, that differ starting a certain age. Here again, the two surfaces correspond to two different health status. This is consistent is the data, that seems to indicate that individual with worse health type or worse health status have a higher death probability at a relatively advanced age, even if they are disadvantaged on other levels earlier on."
