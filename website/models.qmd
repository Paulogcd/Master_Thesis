title: "Models"

This page is under construction. It is dedicated to the presentation of the intermediary models I worked on and am working on within my Master Thesis.

## Framework model 1

This model is finished, and its associaed notebook [can be found here](/resources/Framework_model_1.html).

It aims to set a first simplified version of the general framework I want to use.

In this context: 

- health is binary (good or bad health status),
- weather is binary (normal state or deviation state), 
- weather does not affect the probability of dying.

I manage to get a first idea of what my master thesis aims to look at, comparing societies with different probabilities of having a weather deviation state. 
The two main plots I manage to obtain are the following:

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Utility trajectories with extreme weather deviation probabilities](/resources/Framework_model_1plot1.png "Extreme values trajectories")

![Aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of weather deviation probability](/resources/Framework_model_1plot2.png "Aggregated intertemporal utilities")
::: 

The first figure represents the aggregated utility of two societies, one in which there is no weather deviation at all (blue line),
and the other where the weather is always in a deviation state (red line).
Note that the general decreasing trend with period is due to the absence of individual reproduction in this model.

The second figure represents the different levels of aggregated intertemporal utilities in function of the probability of the weather being normal.
We see what seems to be a linear relationship between the aggregated intertemporal utility and the probability of the weather being normal.

## Framework model 2

This model is currently under work. 
Its aim is to add to the general framework a continuous variable for temperature. 

[It can be found here](/resources/Framework_model_2.html). 

## Visualisation 

I am also working on some model visualisation.
A notebook about it can be found [here](/resources/Visualisation.html).
