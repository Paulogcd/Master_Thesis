This page is under construction.

This webpage is dedicated to the presentation of the models I worked on within my Master Thesis.

## Framework model 1

This model is currently under work. 
Its aim is to be a simplified version of the general framework I want to use. 

[It can be found here](/resources/Framework_model_1.html). 

## Framework model 2

This model is currently under work. 
Its aim is to add to the general framework a continuous variable for temperature. 

[It can be found here](/resources/Framework_model_2.html). 

## Visualisation 

I am also working on some model visualisation.
A notebook about it can be found [here](/resources/Visualisation.html).
